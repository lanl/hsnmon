# High Speed Network Monitoring Tool (HSNMon)

HSNMon is a network monitoring service for collecting Omni-Path port counters from endpoints and switches.
It can collect port counters via FastFabric tools and additionally can query the fabric manager directly to
provide higher granularity monitoring than FastFabric tools can provide.
